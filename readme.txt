Requires at least: 2.7
Tested up to: 3.0.1
Stable tag: 1.2

Automatically scroll `Write Post` and `Write Page` screens to the editor.

== Description ==

On monitors with limited vertical resolution (often the case with laptops),
the post/page editor can appear inconveniently far down on the page. With
the WriteScroll plugin active, these pages will automatically scroll to an
optimal position for editing, when you visit `Write Post` or `Write Page`.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `writescroll` folder and its contents to your `wp-contents/plugins` directory.
2. Activate in the `Plugins` menu.
